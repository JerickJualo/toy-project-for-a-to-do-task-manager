    "     - Store as `self.acc_id` on each new `Account`  \n",

    "2. **Instance Registry**  \n",
    "   - Added `all_acc` class list to store **every** `Account` object upon creation  \n",

    "3. **Empty Initial Store**  \n",
    "   - **Before:** `details_account` initialized with a single entry  \n",

    "4. **Cleaner Representation**  \n",
